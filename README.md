# Bomb Defusal Game
This repository contains the files for a bomb defusal game I created based on the video game "Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes". Each puzzle is stored as an Atmel Studio 7.0 project file, however, they are combined as the PuzzlesMain.c C file which was installed on an ATMEL 1284 microchip. The Timer.c file manages the game clock and sound effects and was installed on another separate ATMEL 1284 microchip. Also included is a written report going into detail about the project as well as the game manual. Below is a link to a video demonstration of the project as a whole.
